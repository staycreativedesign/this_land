								On April 5, 1945, Oklahoma A&amp;M President Henry Bennett received a telegram from U.S. Senator Elmer Thomas: 
							</p>
							<blockquote>
								Captain Taylor of the Navy Department proposes to establish at Stillwater school for teaching Japanese language. Open about 15th of June and build up to enrollment of 750 to 800 by end of July. Navy official either at Stillwater or on way to make arrangements.1 
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								So began a brief and fascinating episode at Oklahoma A&amp;M (renamed Oklahoma State University in 1957) when handpicked naval officers were sent on a classified mission to Stillwater. Their assignment was to become fluent in the Japanese language in advance of the war's impending conclusion and aftermath. It is a story not only about those participants, many of whom enjoyed enormous success following the war, but also their devoted Japanese teachers, or sensei.
							</p>
							<p>
								Ensign Robert E. Graalman, my father, couldn't have been more surprised and pleased to receive his assignment. Having graduated from special training on the East Coast in May of 1945, he opened his orders to discover he would return to Stillwater, Oklahoma, where he had begun college in 1938 as a 16-year-old freshman, only 70 miles from his hometown of Okeene. He was one of two Oklahomans to be so ordered.
							</p>
							<p>
								When World War II began, little information about this enemy could be found in the West-the study of Japanese language, history, and culture virtually non-existent in the nation's schools and military establishment. Jessica Arntson, an expert on the sensei experience in World War II, points out, 2 as WWII neared, "Only 60 non-Japanese students were studying Japanese in American universities"-most of that being theoretical and not applied. The military would have to start from scratch, training those who would be involved in the use of language to gather, interpret, and analyze information needed to conclude the war and carry out a successful occupation.
							</p>
							<p>
								Two similar and competing efforts, one sponsored by the Army and one by the Navy, ran simultaneously, their assignments being to produce as many fluent Japanese speakers and readers as possible in the shortest amount of time. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In various places around the country, small groups of carefully selected officers became "special students," largely for their literary and linguistic gifts, in an intense effort to produce interrogators, translators, analysts, and code-breakers who would help clear the way to the peace table. And their roles would likely be extended for years, as mountains of captured documents would need translating for various purposes, including charging and trying war criminals—important to most Americans, whose impressions of the enemy had been, from Pearl Harbor on, highly charged and stereotypical.
							</p>
							<p>
								For the Navy, the program commenced at two of the country’s most renowned campuses: University of California-Berkeley and Harvard College. The Harvard program lasted less than a year, due to a conflict between Harvard administration and naval officials—Harvard insisted that the course materials should be chosen by Harvard administrators, and the Navy wanted to supply its own. At Berkeley, the program began promisingly, but with residence status uncertain for Japanese sensei returning to California, a new site would be required. On June 23, 1942, the program was moved to the University of Colorado, in Boulder, where it remained for three years, as hundreds of ensigns took on the rigorous curriculum.

								How those students, as well as the sensei and their families, eventually arrived at Stillwater originated with educators and city officials looking for ways to improve the local economy. The president of the school, Henry Bennett, was well known in Washington, D.C. In fact, after the war, he was a key figure in President Truman's Point Four program, an international investment of American know-how and capital, primarily involving agricultural education. Years later, Point Four served as a model for what became the Peace Corps. Throughout the war, city and university employees had aggressively pursued military programs that could utilize campus space-much unused with so many absent men—and bring federal dollars to town, which had already enjoyed some benefits from smaller efforts. Now they sought one considered a prize: training air navigators. When the disappointing news arrived that Stillwater had been rejected, officials lamented having wasted much of its budget to lobby in D.C. Therefore, the subsequent telegram announcing the language school couldn't have been more timely, and things moved swiftly to implementation.

								More than 20,000 officers had been interviewed for the assignment, such being its importance. Out of that number, more than 1,100—mostly men-were selected. Of those, upwards of some 500 eventually arrived in Stillwater, including over 100 who had started in Boulder.3 They were expected to master, in just over a year, an amount that a student in a typical language curriculum would receive over two decades of study-from having no expertise to complete fluency, command, and familiarity with all things Japanese. Their selection was competitive—Phi Beta Kappa and a flair for verbal games and solving puzzles being common traits—and their performances were closely monitored; any evidence of not performing up to expected standards meant immediate expulsion.

								My father began his war service as a Seabee in Hawaii, often assigned to censor letters. A studious individual, he enjoyed an uncommon brand of humor. He liked to tell his children that he had “faced grave danger during the war,” especially for a time when he noticed that one sailor had unwittingly switched a letter for his wife into an envelope addressed to his mistress, and vice-versa. When challenged to prove how dangerous that might have been, my father protested: “Why, he might’ve wanted to kill me to keep me quiet!”
								Now Ensign Graalman went home for the war’s conclusion. He had applied to study Chinese in Boulder, which was also taught at that site, but the Navy decided otherwise and sent him to Stillwater.

								In addition to other matters related to geography and culture, little were the students prepared for the heat of an Oklahoma summer.
